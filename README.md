# Overview
I've rewritten [Functional-OO](https://github.com/lizhuoli1126/Functional-OO) in ES6/7 to show how does the new JS grammar make the functional programming more streamlined.

And also I've added some engineering bootstraps in `gulp.babel.js` and unit tests in the folder 'test'.

To build and run tests:
```
npm run build
npm test
```

Only `promisify`, `curry` , `Optional` and `Monad` have been implemented.
